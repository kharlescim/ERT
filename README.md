# Predicting USDM Maps with Mutual Information & Machine Learning <br>
This project implements a Random Forest Model to objectively classify drought severity across the U.S. using a combination of observed, modeled, and remotely sensed climate indicators. The goal is to predict the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) categories by learning from historical data and quantifying the importance of each drought indicator using information-theoretic metrics like mutual information (MI) and fractional information (FI).  <br>

Included in this repository is the script to generate, run, and save the model and its predictions, along with several Jupyter notebooks to calculate mutual information and plot drought maps.
